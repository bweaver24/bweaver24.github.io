				<li>This website is a website I made from scratch in my Computer Programming class. Currently I am at least a day ahead from everyone else. I love programming and it is amazing. I programmed this website because I also like playing FPS Games at home. My favorites are Rainbow Six Siege and Overwatch. I love these two games and wanted to dedicate a website to them explaining their eSports leagues. I will be adding on more games as time progresses.</li>
				<li> Adding Soon: osu! </li>
