			<ul>About the Raleigh Major of 2019:
				<li>The Raleigh Major is a Rainbow Six Seige tournament that took place for the first time this year in France. The team that won the tournament, was an underdog that noone knew about! It was amazing to watch all the funny fails and amazing plays that happened in the Raleigh Major. The teams consisted of around 5-7 players. It is the same in a sense like Overwatch League, except every team advertises their own brand. The Raleigh Major was really fun to watch. I can't wait to watch again next year!</li>
