			<ul>About Beast Saber VR
				<li>Beat Saber is a game for the PC. It is my favorite VR Game. The entire goal of Beat Saber is to slice your two colored lightsabers to the rythem. You have a blue lightsaber and a red lightsaber. You swing the corresponding color of your lightsaber to the corresponding color of the block. You also have to swing it the way the arrow says you should. It seems really hard, but once you do it for a while you get the hang of it really easily. It is my favorite VR game by far, and it really gives me a workout!</li>
